# Italian eInvoice API

The Invoicetronic API is a RESTful service ensuring smooth and compliant invoice transactions through the Servizio di Interscambio, commonly referenced as SDI or FatturaPA.

Designed for the modern developer, the eInvoice API abstracts away SDI complexities in exchange for simplicity with firm control over the invoice send/receive cycle. It offers advanced features such as encryption at rest, pre-flight invoice validation, flexible upload options, webhooks notification, event logging, and more.

Open-source Client SDKs, CLI tools, a complete OpenAPI documentation, and a free sandbox are included with the offering.

We are an official FatturaPA/SDI partner and exchange millions of invoices yearly throughout our REST API services.
